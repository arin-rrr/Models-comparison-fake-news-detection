# Comparison LR, RF and LSTM NN on fake news detection task

**Description:** Comparison of ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and NN approach (LSTM) for binary classification - *detection of fake news*.

I compared the efficiency of ML algorithms and NN approach for detection fake news and:
- select hyperparametrs of LR, RF using GridSearch
- select text vectorization method - TfIdfVectorizer, CountVectorizer
- select NN architecture
- select the best model among them (accuracy)
